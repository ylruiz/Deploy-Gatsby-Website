Some of the most popular are <a href="https://visualstudio.com" target="_blank">Microsoft Visual Studio</a>, <a href="https://atom.io" target="_blank">Atom</a>, <a href="https://sublimetext.com" target="_blank">Sublime Text</a>, <a href="https://brackets.io" target="_blank">Brackets</a>, etc.</td></tr><tr><td align="center"><strong>UI and layout tools</strong></td><td>Interface design tools make it easy to design multiple layouts as well as export images and code for use in production. Some of them also allow basic interactivity such as clicks and swipes, making possible to share your markup online and use it for basic interface testing. Here are some of the most popular options at the time of this writing: <a href="https://sketchapp.com" target="_blank">Sketch</a> which is only disponible for Mac, <a href="https://affinity.serif.com/en-us/designer/" target="_blank"> Affinity Designer</a>, <a href="https://www.adobe.com/productd/xd.html" target="_blank">Adobe XD</a>, <a href="https://figma.com" target="_blank">Figma</a>, <a href="https://www.invisionapp.com/home" target="_blank">In Vision</a>, and <a href="https://uxpin.com" target="_blank">UXPin</a>.</td></tr><tr><td align="center"><strong>Web graphic creation tools</strong></td><td>Even though it is possible to create the images that you need using one interface design tool, there are also programs that focus only on the creation of images.

For that reason, it is important to note that they also utilize a certain set of tools in order to make easier the communication between members of the team.
For instance, they normally use:</p><ul><li><strong>Version Control Platforms</strong>: <a href="https://git-scm.com/" target="_blank">GIT</a>, <a href="https://github.com/" target="_blank">GitHub</a></li><li><strong>Project management software</strong>:  <a href="https://www.teamwork.com/" target="_blank">Teamwork</a>, <a href="https://trello.com/" target="_blank">Trello</a></li><li><strong>Team chat software</strong>: <a href="https://www.skype.com/en/" target="_blank">Skype</a></li></ul><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>I hope this article has helped you to know better some of the more popular roles that contribute to the website&#x27;s creation as well as their responsibilities, their respective average salaries, and the tools that they usually use.
Last but not least, you should always remember that there are also non-technical skills that every web designer or developer need to have.
