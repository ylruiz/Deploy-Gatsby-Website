Personally, when I read the term for the first time, I could understand that it refers to a person who job is to create or develop computer software. But, that is a very generic concept which is not enough to really know what to be a programmer involves. So, I asked myself some questions that can be interesting for you too.</p>\n<p>Some of them are the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"#programmer\">What really means to be a programmer?</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#occupations\">What are the range of occupations that involves programming?</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#salary\">What is the average salary for each of them?</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#most-demanded\">Which one are the most demanded?</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#programming-languages\">What are the most popular programming languages? Why?</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#skills\">What skills need to have every programmer?</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"programmer\"> What is a Programmer? </h2>\n<p>A programmer is a prerson who job includes writting code, testing and fixing bugs. She/He convert a design into instructions that a computer can follow. But, to be a good programmer is more than that, her/his code need to be understand for other programmers or for yourself some months later, which means that the you should write clean and organized code. However, at the beginning you don't need to think so much in that because practicing, studying, and gaining experience are keys for it.</p>\n<p>Normally, programmers work in a team under a team leader which supervises their work.</p>\n<p>There are two type of programmers:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>General programmers whose write code for many type of software.</li>\n<li>Specialized programmers whose focus on one type or area of programming.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"occupations\"> Range of occupations </h3>\n<p>The fact that there are specialized programmers make possible that exits in the software industry a huge range of occupations that involve programming, as you will see in the table below.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Occupation</th>\n<th>Description</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Software Developer</td>\n<td>...</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Web Developer</td>\n<td>...</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Mobile Developer</td>\n<td>...</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Embedded Firmware Developer</td>\n<td>...</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Software Engineer</td>\n<td>A software engineer is a person who applies the principles of software enginnering to design, development, maintenance, testing, and evaluate a software</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Computer Scientist</td>\n<td>...</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Game Programmer</td>\n<td>...</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Software Analyst</td>\n<td>...</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h4 id=\"salary\"> Average salary for each of them</h4>\n<h4 id=\"most-demanded\"> The most demanded</h4>\n<h3 id=\"programming-languages\">The most popular programming languages </h3>\n<h3 id=\"skills\">Skills that every programmer need to have </h3>\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>I believe a computer programmer or coder can refer to a specialist in an specific area of computer or someone who can write code for many kind of software. It is a field with so many areas, you can choose which one you prefer and go for it. I trusly recomend you to follow the next way:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Choose what field do you prefer.</li>\n<li>Learn the programming languages(s) you need to know.</li>\n<li>Domain the main skills that every programmer need to know.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Don't stop, stay in your way and practice every day with example or with some project of your inspiration. That will ensure you the oportunity to be a great and succeful professional.</p>\n<h3>Over to you</h3>","frontmatter":{"path":"/2020/03/30/Do_you_want_to_be_a_Programmer","tags":["General"]}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/2020-04-01/"},"html":"<p>Some Text</p>","frontmatter":{"path":"/2020/04/01/Topic_3","tags":["Design"]}}}}}
