So, a website is a collection of electronic files and web pages related to a particular topic, and they have a specific purpose.
It is publicly accessible, and its interlinked web pages share a common domain name in the World Wide Web, located in at least one web server.</p><p>On the Internet are a huge variety of static and dynamic websites. Each of them is specialized in a particular kind of content or use and can have many classifications.
For instance, the twelve more popular types of websites are blog, corporate, e-commerce, portfolio, brochure, crowdfunding, news or magazine, social media, TV or video streaming, educational, portal, and wiki or community forum.

Usually, websites are created and maintained by an individual, group, business, or organization. Those people that work in the development web process can design or/and develop websites.</p><p>Wait a moment, <strong>are web design and web development the same? Are they interchangeable terms with the same meaning?</strong> The simple answer is <strong>NO</strong>.
However, I remember when I started to learn about web development, I found myself confused about the difference between web design and web development. Eventually, multiple questions about that subject came to my mind, such as:</p><ul><li><a href="#web">What Web Design and Web Development mean?</a></li><li><a href="#web-job">What involves to be a web designer and a web developer?</a></li><li><a href="#web-salary">What are the average earnings for web designers and web developers?</a></li><li><a href="#web-learn">Where can you learn web design and web development?</a></li></ul><h2 id="web">What Web Design and Web Development mean?</h2><h3>Web Development</h3><p>Web development involves building, creating, and maintaining websites.
Among web professionals, this term usually refers to the main non-design aspects of building websites.
It includes several tasks, such as web engineering, web design, web content development, client-side/server-side scripting, web server, and network security configuration.</p><h3>Web Design</h3><p>Web design is an activity that consists in the creation of websites.
It includes different areas, like web graphic design, interface design, and user experience design.
It covers other aspects such as navigability, interactivity, usability, and information architecture.
Moreover, web design involves media interaction, for example, audio, text, image, and search engine optimization.</p><h2 id="web-job">What involves to be a web designer and a web developer?</h2><p>There are two primary jobs involved in creating a website: web designers and web developers, who often work closely together on a website. The following table shows the main differences between each other.</p><table><thead><tr><th>Aspect</th><th>Web Designer</th><th>Web Developer</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Definition</td><td>Web designers are responsible for the visual aspect of the website, which includes the layout, coloring, and typography. It is also great if they have a working knowledge of markup languages, such as HTML and CSS.</td><td>Web developers turn the design -the website structure, design markups, and prototypes- into code. As a result, they transform the vision into a fully functional website.</td></tr><tr><td>Skills</td><td>Web designers are responsible for the interface of a website, which means that they should consider developing the following set of skills: <br/> - <strong>Visual Design</strong>: The most common tools in the visual design are grid systems, typography, color theory, and web fonts. <br/> - <strong>User experience (UX)</strong>: A web designer who understands UX practices always will create a website from a user-first perspective. <br/> - <strong>Communication</strong>, <strong>Time-Management</strong>, <strong>Proactivity</strong>, <strong>Creativity</strong>, and <strong>Digital Marketing</strong> skills <br/> - <strong>HTML and CSS</strong>: Those are expected coding languages that a web designer should know.</td><td>Here are some of the most popular skills to have in this role: <br/> - <strong>HTML/CSS/JavaScript</strong>: Those are programming languages that every web developer needs to master. <br/> - <strong>CSS and JavaScript Frameworks</strong>: Bootstrap, Foundation, Node.js, React.js, Vue.js, Angular.js <br/> - <strong>CSS preprocessing</strong>: SASS, LESS <br/> - <strong>Back-end basics</strong>: APIs, databases, and cybersecurity. <br/> - <strong>Testing and debugging</strong>: It is essential to know how to test your code for any possible errors.</td></tr><tr><td>Tools</td><td>Several types of tools make web designers&#x27; labor more easer, for example: <br/> - <strong>Image Editor</strong>: Adobe Photoshop, Adobe Illustrator <br/> - <strong>Wireframe Tool</strong>: Sketch, Balsamiq <br/> - <strong>Stock photography resources</strong>: Unsplash, iStock <br/> - <strong>Image optimization</strong>: ResizeImage.net, TinyPNG <br/> - <strong>Typographies and icons libraries</strong>: Font Awesome, Google Fonts <br/> - <strong>Prototyping software</strong>: In Vision Studio, Adobe XD</td><td>Some tools that web developers use are the next: <br/> - <strong>Integrated Development Environment (IDE)</strong>: Visual Code Studio <br/> - <strong>Version Control Platform</strong>: GitHub, GitLab <br/> - <strong>Browser developer tools</strong>: Chrome DevTools, Firefox DevTools <br/> - <strong>API &amp; Testing Tools</strong>: Postman, LambdaTest <br/> - <strong>Collaboration Tools</strong>: JIRA, Zoom</td></tr></tbody></table><p>Due to web designers and web developers frequently have close collaboration, it is important to note that they utilize a certain set of tools that facilities communication between each other. For instance:</p><ul><li><strong>Design-Developer collaboration tool</strong>: Figma, In Vision</li><li><strong>Project management software</strong>: Teamwork, Trello</li><li><strong>Team chat software</strong>: Skype, Slack</li></ul><h2 id="web-salary">What are the average earnings for web designers and web developers?</h2><div class="canvas-container"><canvas height="120" width="100"></canvas></div><h2 id="web-learn">Where can you learn web design and web development?</h2><p>There are different ways to learn about web design or web development. For instance:</p><h3>For designers</h3><ul><li><a href="https://www.academyart.edu/academics/web-design/online-degrees/">The Academy of Art University</a></li><li>Subscribe to platforms like Dribbble and Behance.</li><li>Go through all of the tutorials provided by your preferred design software.</li><li>Subscribe to blogs and YouTube channels that specialize in web design tips and tutorials, such as Smashing Magazine and WebDesignerDepot.</li></ul><h3>For Developers</h3><ul><li><a href="https://www.coursera.org/">Coursera</a></li><li><a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/">FreeCodeCamp</a></li><li><a href="https://egghead.io/">EggHead</a></li><li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/learncodeacademy/">LearnCode.academy on YouTube</a></li></ul><p>I also recommend you to follow the tutorials of the tools or frameworks that you want to learn. Additionally, enrolling in meetups is a great way to maintain yourself learning new stuff.</p><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>Now you know the main differences between Web Design and Web Development, as well as where you can learn about that stuff.
You also have a brief understanding of what to be a web designer and a web developer means and the expected salaries for each one.<br/>
